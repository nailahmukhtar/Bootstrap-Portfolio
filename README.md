# Bootstrap-Portfolio
My personal portfolio website built using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

## Description

### Purpose
Build a copy of my [previous portfolio website](https://nailahmukhtar.github.io/Portfolio) using the Bootstrap framework to showcase the work I can do using prebuilt components. I built this with a view to showcasing the skills I have learnt so far with css frameworks.

What I did
- When the page is loaded the website presents the following, which all build on bootstrap components
    - a navigation bar
	- a hero section with my name, an avatar and some text introducing myself
	- sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
- When the links in the navigation are clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about my work, the section contains titled images of my applications, displayed using bootstrap cards
- When buttons on the cards are clicked, the user is taken to that deployed application/ placeholders for now.
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
